# BetterAC

Welcome to README of BetterAC, an AntiCheat plugin for your PocketMine-MP servers!

This plugin is currently under development maintenance but you are already able to see what its going to do!

## Features
- [x] TPS checker to keep performance perfect

- [x] Update notify system - Be always up to date! 

- [x] Language System - Your server is chinese? No - problem, just create a certain file. <a href='Languages.md'> Click here for instructions </a>

- [x] Anti autoclicker - what do you think is legit? 20 CPS? 30? set it in Config, and noone will be able to be faster!

- [x] Anti speed - Disable fast runner on your server

- [x] Anti NoClip - Players can fly threw blocks? Let's disable that 

- [x] Anti Spam - Stop Spamming on your server!

- [ ] Anti killaura - work in progress: 40% done

- [x] Everything is customizable! Just go in config.yml and see what you can change!

- [x] Individual device management - This plugin detects if you are playing on mobile, PC or a console to customizable max. clicks per second (cps) or range in blocks

## What this plugin is not supposed to do
I wont add Anti X-Ray or anthing to see players / tiles / blocks and stuff faster, because this Anticheat was made for PVP

This plugin does not check for fly, because pocketmine's flight anticheat is good enough.

## Any other suggestions or errors?
Please open an Issue!
